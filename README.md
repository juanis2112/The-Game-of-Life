Description and Implementation of The Game of Life in Python and Matlab

# The Game of Life
The Game of Life is a zero-player game that was designed in 1970 by John Horton Conway, a British mathematician. It is said that this game is a cellular automata, since it is a mathematical model of a dynamic system that evolves in discrete steps, that is, quantifiable units of time with integer values at regular intervals. It consists of a set of cells that acquire different values that change according to mathematical expressions that are determined by the states of the neighboring cells. It has also been typecast in the category of simulation games because it aims to imitate real- life processes. 

#The project
The following project contains the implementation of this zero-player game in Python and Matlab with two files in PDF (one in Spanish and one in English) that contain the history, description and rules of the game along with an explanation of how the implementation written in Matlab and Python works.
